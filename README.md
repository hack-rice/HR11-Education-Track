# HackRice 11 Education Track

## Track Description
Over the past months, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed both the shortcomings and strengths of virtual educational tools. Recently, the challenges posed by online education have been at the forefront of technological innovation, and as classrooms return to an in-person format, new digital tools that boost productivity in the classroom and support students will continue to have an impact. This track is an opportunity to develop new digital tools for education and learning in a post COVID-19 world.

## Prompt
In this track, we challenge you to develop tools that aid education in a post COVID-19 world, whatever that means to you. This could be a tool for students or teachers, a tool for in-person or virtual classrooms, a tool for underfunded schools, or anything else you can imagine. This track is intentionally broad to leave you room to innovate and come up with creative solutions to difficult problems.

In your presentation, identify technologies implemented, the educational problems you address, any data used, and the significance of your project.
